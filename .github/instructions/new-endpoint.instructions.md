# Instruction: Add a New Create Endpoint

Generated by Copilot.

To add a new "Create" (POST) endpoint for an entity, follow these steps:

1. **Entity**: Ensure the entity class exists in `Products/Domain/Entities/`.
2. **DTO**: Create a `Create[Entity]Dto` in `Products/Models/` for the request payload.
3. **Mapping**: Add mapping between `Create[Entity]Dto` and `[Entity]` in `MappingProfile.cs`.
4. **Repository**: Add an async `AddAsync([Entity] entity)` method to the repository interface and implementation in `Products/Repositories/`.
5. **Service**: Add an async `CreateAsync(Create[Entity]Dto dto)` method to the service interface and implementation in `Products/Services/`.
6. **Controller**: Add a `[HttpPost]` action in the controller in `Products/Controllers/` that:
    - Accepts `Create[Entity]Dto` as input.
    - Calls the service's `CreateAsync` method.
    - Returns `201 Created` with the created entity or its DTO.
7. **Validation**: Add FluentValidation rules for `Create[Entity]Dto` if needed.
8. **Tests**: Add/Update unit and integration tests for the new endpoint in `Products.Tests/`.
9. **Documentation**: Update Swagger XML comments and README if required.



# Instruction: Add a New Get Endpoint

Generated by Copilot.

To add a new "Get" (GET) endpoint for an entity, follow these steps:

1. **Entity**: Ensure the entity class exists in `Products/Domain/Entities/`.
2. **DTO**: Create a `[Entity]Dto` in `Products/Models/` for the response payload.
3. **Mapping**: Add mapping between `[Entity]` and `[Entity]Dto` in `MappingProfile.cs`.
4. **Repository**: Add async methods to the repository interface and implementation in `Products/Repositories/`:
    - `GetByIdAsync(Guid id)` for single entity retrieval.
    - `GetAllAsync()` for collection retrieval.
5. **Service**: Add async methods to the service interface and implementation in `Products/Services/`:
    - `GetByIdAsync(Guid id)`
    - `GetAllAsync()`
6. **Controller**: Add `[HttpGet("{id}")]` and/or `[HttpGet]` actions in the controller in `Products/Controllers/` that:
    - Call the service's `GetByIdAsync` or `GetAllAsync` methods.
    - Return `200 OK` with the entity DTO or collection.
    - Return `404 Not Found` if the entity does not exist.
7. **Tests**: Add/Update unit and integration tests for the new endpoint in `Products.Tests/`.
8. **Documentation**: Update Swagger XML comments and README if required.
